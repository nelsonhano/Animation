        <p>
          The aim is to provide the most benefits for the player with a team of professionals in terms of representation, 
          scouting and analysis, always supported on the big data. We believe that what happens outside the pitch affects the 
          performances within the field and we always try to focus on every single detail to maximize the potential of the player. 
          Thanks to our professionality, The Player counts on the trust of the clubs and agencies segmented throughout the strategic areas of
           European football. That allows us to get the best deals 
           between players, clubs, or agencies, most of all between the 5 biggest European leagues
